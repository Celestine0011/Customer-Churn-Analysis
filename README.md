# Predicting Customer Churn

## Objective: 
To train the model using existing datasets and predicting the likelihood that a customer will churn,
as this will help to to make actionable insights to retain customers and increase customers’ lifetime values.

**Customer churn** prediction refers to detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or terminate their subscription to a service. It is very critical for businesses because gaining new clients often costs more than retaining the existing ones.

## What is churn analysis?
Churn analysis is the evaluation of a company's customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your products and how it's used by people.

Customer churn is a common problem that exists across businesses in many industries. Investing in acquiring new clients is a non-negotiable investment for any company. When a client leaves, it represents a significant loss for the business. A lot of resources needs to be channelled into replacing them.

Some of the reasons why customers are lost include:
- Incorrect pricing
- Unimpressive renewal offers
- Lack of market understanding
- poor customer service
- Overcommunication and spamming
- Lack of brand loyalty

The ability to predict when a client is likely to leave and offering them enticing incentives that will make them stay, can offer huge savings to a business. Business managers have to understand the factors that keep customers engaged and this is a strategy that requires constant development. It is important to note that finding patterns using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is as important as the final prediction itself. A Churn prediction task remains unfinished if the data patterns are not found in EDA.

## Importance of Churn analysis:-
Having a predictive churn model creates for the business managers, awareness and quantifiable metrics to fight against in their retention efforts. It gives the ability to pattern the habits of customers who leave, so they can step in before the customers make that decision. Without this, business decisions would be made and acted upon based on broad assumptions, not a data-driven model that reflects how customers really act.

 Without a strong understanding of your customers and their behaviors, it’s hard to retain them so the first step in creating this model is understanding your customer behavior from customer data points. Let's see what kind of data we would need to to assess the triggers that caused them to ultimately leave the company.

## The data dictionary of this dataset is shown below:

#####  Each row represents a customer; each column contains the customer’s attributes as described in the column metadata.
##### The dataset includes information about:
##### Customers who left within the last month — the column is labelled **Churn**.
##### Different services that each customer has signed up for — phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
##### Customer account information — how long they’ve been a customer, contract length, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
##### Customer demographic info — gender, age — range, and if they have partners and dependents.

This churn prediction modelling technique attempts to explore some customer behaviours and attributes that relates to the reason and time of customers leaving.

I have used the IBM sample Telco Customer Churn dataset which is available on Kaggle. You can find the dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn">here</a>

## Steps followed during entire analysis:-
#### Step 1: Data acquisition
#### Step 2: Assess and clean the data
#### Step 3: Conduct exploratory data analysis to answer the questions & create visualizations (Final visualization code)
#### Step 4: Train,adjust and evaluate the model.
#### Step 5: Summaries
